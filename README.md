# BORNPINKDatabase

I created a BLACKPINK World Tour ticket database using MYSQL and MYSQL Workbench. After learning SQL commands, I created this database which has the tour dates, cities, countries, and ticket sale numbers organized into two tables. The first table is mainly focused on where the group are touring so far in 2022. The second table focuses on the amount of tickets that are remaining for those specific tour dates, with seeing how many tickets are remaining, and how many of those tickets are resell tickets or platinum tickets. This database is focused on a few of the group BLACKPINK's North American tour dates and the data is based on actual information that can be found on ticketmaster and also the groups official tweets containing their tour stops and dates.
